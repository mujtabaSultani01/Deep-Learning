    "## Recurrent Neural Network\n",
    "**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a type of deep learning algorithm that are used to process sequential data, such as text or time series data. They have been widely used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. RNNs are also used for time series tasks such as predicting stock prices or forecasting weather.\n",
