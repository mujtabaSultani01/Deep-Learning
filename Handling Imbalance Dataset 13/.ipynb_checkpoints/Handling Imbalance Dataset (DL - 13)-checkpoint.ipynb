    "# Handling Imbalance Dataset\n",
    "**An imbalanced dataset** is a dataset where the target classes are not equally represented. This can be an issue for machine learning models, as they can become biased towards the majority class and fail to accurately identify the minority class. To address this issue, data scientists often use resampling techniques to balance the dataset.\n",
    "* There are several methods that can be used to handle imbalanced datasets in deep learning, including data augmentation, oversampling, undersampling, and class weighting. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to evaluate each one carefully to determine which is best suited for the task at hand."

    "* The first technique to handle imbalance dataset is **Under sampling majority class.** Let's say we have 99000 samples belonging to one class and 1000 samples belonging to another class. Let's say this is fraud detection scenario where 1000 transactions are fraud and 99000 transactions are not fraud. So to tackle this imbalance we take randomly 1000 samples from 99000 samples class and we discard remaining samples and then we combine these 1000 samples with the red class 1000 samples and we train our model. Obviously this is not the best approach because we throwing a way so much data."

Now you divide those 3000 class into three parts. 1st you take the first part and you combine it with the 1000 red samples and you train the model. 2nd you take the second part and you combine it with the red samples and you train the model. 3rd you take the third part and combine it with the red samples and train the model.
