    "# Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\n",
    "**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** is a pre-trained deep learning model developed by Google for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It uses a transformer-based architecture to learn contextual relations between words in a sentence or text. BERT is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets in the NLP field."
